<p>Oracc uses the Plane 15 PUA from F0000-FFFFD as a space to create
signs pending possible encoding, and to maintain variant forms of
signs that do not merit separate encoding. All management of the Oracc
PUA is consolidated in the OSL project.</p>

<p>The region from F0000-F0FFF is used for core Oracc additions; the
region from F1000 are used for font-specific additions.</p>

<esp:sh>Retention Policy</esp:sh>

<p>Characters are added to the Oracc PUA from F0000-F0FFF are
considered permanent and are never removed.  If a PUA character is
subsequently encoded the OSL is updated to reflect the encoded
character but the version in the PUA is left as it is.</p>

<p>Characters from F1000 upwards should be considered impermanent and
are used for font development where a period of refinement may make it
convenient to maintain a number of characters pending resolution of
their fate.</p>

<esp:h>Definitional Data Table</esp:h>

<p>A running account of the PUA usage is kept in <esp:link
url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracc/osl/refs/heads/master/00etc/oracc-pua.tab">oracc-pua.tab</esp:link>.</p>

<p>The data format for this table is:</p>

<pre>
OID        SIGN-NAME      PUA-CODE      SCRIPT     ORACC-PUA-BLOCK
</pre>

<p>An OID must be assigned in Oracc's OID table for any character that
is being added to the Oracc PUA.</p>

<p>PUA-CODE is the uppercase hex codepoint in Plane 15.</p>

<p>SCRIPT is one of the script codes Xsux, Pcun, Pelm.</p>

<p>ORACC-PUA-BLOCK is an indicator of groups of characters added to
the Oracc PUA; by convention these are numbered 9.x.</p>

<esp:ssh>Block 9.1</esp:ssh>

<p>This block was created in September/October 2024 for number signs and
variants that were not encoded at that point.</p>

<esp:ssh>Block 9.2</esp:ssh>

<p>This block was created in October 2024 for non-numerical signs and
variants that were not encoded at that point.</p>
