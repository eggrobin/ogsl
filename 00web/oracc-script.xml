      <esp:sh>Oracc Script Concepts</esp:sh>

      <p>Oracc/OSL supports script variation in various ways. Common
      sets of variants are grouped into named script-styles which
      correspond to OpenType Stylistic Sets. These script-styles
      implement general variations such as the common merger of IM
      with NI₂ but are not intended to capture individual
      manuscript-level variation. A script-style may have individual
      character variants in addition to the Stylistic Set.</p>
      
      <p>The following script-styles are presently defined:</p>

      <table class="pretty">
	<tr><td>Script-style</td><td>OT Stylistic Set</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Default</td><td>(none)</td><td>Selects standard font glyphs.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Early</td><td>ss01</td><td>Selects Early Dynastic glyph forms.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Middle</td><td>ss02</td><td>Selects Ur III/OB glyph forms.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Late</td><td>ss03</td><td>Selects later mergers.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Gudea</td><td>ss02</td><td>Selects Ur III/OB glyphs
	along with de₂=UMUM@s.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>ED12</td><td>ss04</td><td>Selects UET II+ glyphs</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Fara</td><td>ss05</td><td>Selects Fara glyphs</td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>OSL script-styles can be selected in a project configuration
      file or in an ATF protocol.</p>

      <p>Configuration file:</p>

      <pre>&lt;option name="osl-script-style" value="gudea"/></pre>

      <p>ATF protocol:</p>

      <pre>#atf: script gudea</pre>

      <p>Individual character variants may be automatically selected
      via transliteration based on the value or sign/form name or they
      may be selectable using a graphetic suffix, e.g., de₂\s might
      select the UMUM@s version of DE₂ which would be an alternative
      to transliterating as de₂(UMUM@s).</p>
      
      <esp:sh>OSL Script-style Definitions</esp:sh>

      <p>Script-styles are defined in osl.asl.  A script-style label
      is defined using @scriptdef:</p>

      <pre>@scriptdef gudea ss03</pre>

      <p>Script-style information is added to signs and forms with
      @script, which must be repeated for each script-style that is
      required for a given sign.</p>

      <p>The first argument to @script must be a script-style label as
      defined with @scriptdef, followed by a colon. The following
      arguments are a semi-colon-separated list of directives ending
      with a period.</p>

      <p>The following directives are supported:</p>

      <dl>
	<dt>ivs [IVSCODE]</dt><dd>The ivs directive specifies an IVS
	codepoint which can be paired with the current sign's @ucun to
	create a ligature that will select the appropriate variant for
	the sign in the given script-style.  The format matches the
	OSL distinction between individual codepoints, specified as,
	e.g., U+12000, and sequences, specified as x12000.x12000.</dd>
	
	<dt>merge [SIGN]</dt><dd>The merge directive indicates that
	the current sign merges with the SIGN given after 'merge';
	e.g., <code>@script gudea: merge NI₂</code>.  This is not
	used by the font technology, but is used when building
	period-specific sub-signlists.</dd>

	<dt>salt [NUMBER]</dt><dd>The salt directive indicates that
	the current sign should be replaced by the script-alternative
	sign specified by [NUMBER].  Note that [NUMBER] must be
	specified even if it is '1'.</dd>

	<dt>sset [STYLISTIC-SET-CODE]</dt><dd>The sset directive
	enables style-set selection for the current sign to override
	the style-set selection for the script-style; e.g., if
	@scriptdef late usually selects ss03, @script late: ss01
	selects style-set ss01 for this sign.</dd>

	<dt>cvnn [CHAR-VAR-CODE]</dt><dd>The cvnn directive enables
	character variant selection for the current sign.</dd>

      </dl>

      <p>@script can be used both with encoded characters and with
      sequences.  For sequences, the font-related selectors SALT and
      Stylistic Set are not relevant.  IVS can be used, however, to
      select custom ligatures of the sequence that may be defined in
      the font.</p>

      <esp:sh>ATF and Script-styles</esp:sh>

      <p>The OSL processor, sx, generates script-style data that can
      be used by the ATF processor.  If a script-style is
      given in the project configuration file it is output in the
      osl-script attribute of all texts in the project.  If a
      script-style is given in an ATF protocol, it is output in the
      osl-script attribute of the current text; both methods can be
      used, with the protocol overriding the configuration file.</p>

      <p>If salt or ivs directives are given for a sign, corresponding
      attributes are added on grapheme nodes besides the utf8
      attribute.  For salt the attribute value is the number; for ivs
      the attribute value is the Unicode cuneiform sequence consisting
      of the base sign and the IVS, given in UTF-8 encoding.</p>
