  <esp:title>Oracc PUA</esp:title>
  <html>
    <head/>
    <body>
<p>Oracc uses the Plane 15 PUA from F0000-FFFFD as a space to create
signs pending possible encoding, and to maintain variant forms of
signs that do not merit separate encoding. All management of the Oracc
PUA is consolidated in the OSL project.</p>

<p>The region from F0000-F0FFF is used for core Oracc additions; the
region from F1000 and up is used for font-specific additions.</p>

<esp:sh>Retention Policy</esp:sh>

<p>Characters are added to the PUA but are never removed.  If a PUA
character is subsequently encoded the OSL is updated to reflect the
encoded character but the version in the PUA is left as it is.</p>

<esp:sh>Definitional Data Table</esp:sh>

<p>A running account of the PUA usage is kept in <esp:link
url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracc/osl/refs/heads/master/00etc/oracc-pua.tab">oracc-pua.tab</esp:link>.</p>

<p>The data format for this table is:</p>

<pre>
OID|KEY        SIGN-NAME      PUA-CODE      SCRIPT|FONT-KEY      ORACC-PUA-BLOCK
</pre>

<p>A KEY is a namespace for a sign, e.g., tcl8, where there is a variant
'e' form, named tcl8:e~a.</p>

<p>PUA-CODE is the uppercase hex codepoint in Plane 15.</p>

<p>SCRIPT|FONT-KEY is either a script code--Xsux, Pcun--or a font name
which can be used (perhaps with additional metadata outside the scope
of oracc-pua.tab) to locate the font that uses the relevant PUA
character.</p>

<p>ORACC-PUA-BLOCK is an indicator of groups of characters added to
the Oracc PUA; by convention these are numbered 9.x.</p>

<esp:ssh>Block 9.1</esp:ssh>

<p>This block was created in Sept/Oct 2024 for number signs and
variants that were not encoded at that point.</p>

<esp:sh>Data Integrity and the PUA</esp:sh>

<p>In some cases the use of characters in the PUA could subvert data
integrity--the selection of an alternative stacking pattern for a
number would not carry with it the semantics of the encoded stacking
pattern.  It is likely that the Oracc PUA will address this by using a
mechanism such as Ideographic Variation Selectors (IVS) to create font
ligatures that enable the correct base character, with its appropriate
semantics, to be morphed into the character in the PUA via the
combination of BASE+IVS.  This requires further
investigation/implementation/documentation.</p>
