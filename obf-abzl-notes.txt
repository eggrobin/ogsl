U+12323 UMUM should be empty and OBF U+12323 should be in U+12324

U+12132 HI×GAD is a shown as a variant form of U+1212F; HI×GAD not in ABZL

ABZL022 ŠEŠ.KI is wrongly defined as ŠEŠ_NA -- it is shown in
Noto/Santakku as ŠEŠ NA rather than ŠEŠ KI

ABZL087 ŠIM.X is defined as a ligature of ŠIM.GA, which is not
attested.  One of the sign forms in ABZL087 is certainly ŠIM-gunu×PI,
which occurs in Gudea Cylinders.  In this Gudea context ŠIM and
ŠIM-gunu are differentiated, so I have added PUA signs to OSL to
reflect that differentiation.  The reference sign form in OB-Freie is
essentially ŠIM×PI! where PI is slightly mis-organized--the sign
following it is |ŠIM@g×PI|.  I would suggest either adding a PUA sign
for the reference form or making it a ligature of ŠIM+PI.

In Signlist_aBZL_OBF.pdf ABZL472 LIMMU the Noto column is displayed as
U+12409 but it should be U+1243C; I don't know if this is also the
case for Santakku.

SZIBIR.liga has incorrect composition:

  sub u1210B u1230B by SZIBIR.liga;

should be

  sub u1230B u12099 by SZIBIR.liga;
