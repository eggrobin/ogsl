      <p>This page gives the Oracc PUA signs in Oracc PUA section 9.1,
      which was primarily assembled to cover number forms and stacking
      patterns that are not encoded.  Some of these may end up being
      proposed for encoding; some belong elsewere (N57 and friends
      belong in the Proto-Cuneiform block); some of them may end up
      being permanent PUA items.</p>
